# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM and Sentiment Analysis: A Case Study on GameStop

This repository contains a detailed analysis of stock price prediction utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks coupled with sentiment analysis. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of integrating social media sentiment into conventional financial forecasting models, with a specific focus on the GameStop short squeeze event.

## Overview
The analysis delves into the effectiveness of LSTM networks in predicting GameStop stock prices, both before and during the short squeeze phenomenon. Additionally, it examines the impact of incorporating sentiment analysis from social media platforms, such as Reddit, on the predictive performance of the model.

## Key Findings
- The LSTM model demonstrated proficiency in capturing general stock price trends but struggled during periods of high volatility, such as the GameStop short squeeze.
- Integrating sentiment analysis improved the model's ability to adapt to sudden market sentiment shifts, resulting in enhanced prediction accuracy.
- Ethical considerations and regulatory compliance were emphasized throughout the analysis, highlighting the importance of responsible data usage in financial modeling.
